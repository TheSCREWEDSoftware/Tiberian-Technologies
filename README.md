## How to build in Visual Studio

Based on [Guide for scripts.dll Development](https://www.tiberiantechnologies.org/Docs/?page=Guide%20for%20scripts.dll%20Development).

> [!NOTE]  
> This source used and uses the Visual Studio 2012 (VS2012) Build Tools.

This is the way I achieve building the source with no issues, you're free to follow their guide or follow what worked for me.

1. Acquire `Visual Studio 2012`, the only way I know is the one shared in the guide above by [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/en_visual_studio_professional_2012_x86_dvd).

2. Install `Visual Studio 2012`, you may un-select all `Optional` features if you don't wish to install any, they are not required.

3. Download and Install `Visual Studio 2022`.

4. When you run `Visual Studio Installer` you will have option to choose what `Workloads` you wish to install, under `Desktop & Mobile` check the box of `Desktop development with C++` this is the only you will need, and proceed with the rest of the download and instalation.

### Download 

Either one you download is the same outcome

- Tiberian Technologies' [Download](https://www.tiberiantechnologies.org/files/source-4.8.4.zip)

- Github [Download](https://github.com/TheSCREWEDSoftware/Tiberian-Technologies/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) / [Clone](https://github.com/TheSCREWEDSoftware/Tiberian-Technologies.git)

5. Run `scripts_VC2012.sln` that you've downloaded or cloned.

6. If you get prompt about `Review Solution Actions` recommended to choose the latest SDK (`10.0`) in my case, and **DO NOT** upgrade the `Platform Toolset` just leave it as `No Upgrade` and press `OK`.

7. Select `Build` and see the magic happen, you will find the final result in `bin\Debug`.
